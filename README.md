# 🛒 Olist SQL Case Study Project
📌 Project Overview

This project uses the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset to practice and showcase advanced SQL problem-solving skills.
I’ve written 1000+ lines of SQL code solving real-world analytical questions related to customers, sellers, products, orders, and reviews.

The goal is to simulate business intelligence use cases such as:

Tracking sales trends and seasonality

Analyzing customer purchase behavior

Measuring delivery performance

Ranking sellers and products by performance

Identifying high-growth categories

📂 Dataset

The Olist dataset is a public dataset containing Brazilian e-commerce transactions.
Key tables used in this project:

orders → customer orders with timestamps and delivery dates

customers → customer location and IDs

order_items → items included in each order (price, freight)

products → product category and details

sellers → seller details and locations

payments → payment details for each order

reviews → customer reviews and ratings

🛠️ SQL Skills Practiced

This project focuses on intermediate-to-advanced SQL concepts:

# ✔️ Joins – combining data across multiple tables
# ✔️ Aggregations – SUM, COUNT, AVG, HAVING
# ✔️ CTEs – simplifying queries and building step-by-step logic
# ✔️ Recursive CTEs – creating a dynamic date calendar
# ✔️ Window Functions – RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG, LEAD, moving averages
# ✔️ Subqueries – filtering and comparison against aggregates
# ✔️ Case Studies – solving realistic business problems

📊 Example Business Questions Solved

For each customer, calculate their AOV (Average Order Value) and rank customers within their state.

Find the product category with the largest sales growth between 2017 and 2018.

Identify top 5 products in each category based on total sales.

Calculate the time gap between consecutive customer purchases.

Flag sellers whose monthly sales dropped by >30% compared to the previous month.

Find categories where the 90th percentile delivery time is greater than 10 days.

Create a recursive CTE date calendar and detect days with zero sales.

Track record-breaking sales months per product category.

Count customers who ordered in both 2017 and 2018.

Calculate percentage of late deliveries per year.
